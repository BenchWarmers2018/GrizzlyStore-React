## React Front-End

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

1. Git Clone or Pull the project. 

2. Be sure to initialise `npm install` before you `npm start`.

3. If you get an error that says module not found, delete `package-lock.json` and do a `npm install` again. 

4. ??? 

5. Profit! `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
